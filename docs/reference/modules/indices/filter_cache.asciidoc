=== Node Filter Cache

The filter cache is responsible for caching the results of filters (used in
the query). There is one filter cache per node that is shared by all shards.
The cache implements an LRU eviction policy: when a cache becomes full, the
least recently used data is evicted to make way for new data.

The following setting is _static_ and must be configured on every data node in
the cluster:

`indices.cache.filter.size`::

    Controls the memory size for the filter cache , defaults to `10%`. Accepts
    either a percentage value, like `30%`, or an exact value, like `512mb`.
